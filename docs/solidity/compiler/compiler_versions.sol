/*
Versioning
_______________________
Solidity versions follow semantic versioning.
Patch level releases with major release 0 are upwards compatible,
0.x.y can be compiled with 0.x.z where z > y.

Nightly Builds
_______________________
Nightly development builds are an option to try out new features,
they are not meant for production though.

Deploy with Latest Version
_______________________
When deploying contracts the latest version should be used because
breaking changes, features and bug fixes are introduced regularly.
The 0.x version number is currently used to indicate this fast pace.
