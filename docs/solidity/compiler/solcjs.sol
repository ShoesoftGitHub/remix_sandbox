What is solcjs?
_______________________
solcjs is a Solidity compiler that can be installed with npm.
It has less features than the actual solc.
solc-js is derived from the C++ solc by using Emscripten, which means that
both use the same compiler source code.
solc-js can be used in JavaScript project directly.
